# Intro to the Course

Welcome to 6.431x, an introduction to probabilistic models, including random processes and the basic elements of statistical inference.

The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications.  
The world is also full of data.  
Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.

The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:

*  multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions
*  laws of large numbers
*  the main tools of Bayesian inference methods
*  an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)


Upon successful completion of this course, you will:

At a conceptual level:
*  Master the basic concepts associated with probability models .
*  Be able to translate models described in words to mathematical ones.
*  Understand the main concepts and assumptions underlying Bayesian and classical inference .
*  Obtain some familiarity with the range of applications of inference methods .

At a more technical level:
*  Become familiar with basic and common probability distributions .
*  Learn how to use conditioning to simplify the analysis of complicated models.
*  Have facility manipulating probability mass functions , densities , and expectations .
*  Develop a solid understanding of the concept of conditional expectation and its role in inference.
*  Understand the power of laws of large numbers and be able to use them when appropriate.
*  Become familiar with the basic inference methodologies (for both estimation and hypothesis testing ) and be able to apply them.
*  Acquire a good understanding of two basic stochastic processes (Bernoulli and Poisson) and their use in modeling.
*  Learn how to formulate simple dynamical models as Markov chains and analyze them.


## Discussion forum overview

The course provides an online discussion forum for you to communicate with the course team and other learners.  
You may access the forum through the “Discussion" tab at the top of the page, as well as through many embedded discussions within each unit.   
We recommend using the embedded discussions within each unit to discuss topics related to a specific unit's materials, whether it's lectures,   
solved problems, or problem set problems. Please see the guidelines below for more information on how to use these embedded discussions.

For other more general discussions, you may use the “Discussion" tab at the top of the page. When creating a new post, please choose one of the following categories that best describes your post:
*  Introductions: Introduce yourself to your fellow learners and find out more about them!
*  MicroMasters: Ask questions related to the MITx Micromaster Program in Statistics and Data Science and meet other MicroMasters fellows!
*  Course Feedback: Let the course team know how you are finding the course, what you think works well, and what you would like to see improved.
*  Technical Problems: Let the course team know about any technical issues you are dealing with (e.g., playing videos, entering answers, etc).
*  General: Other general discussions.
